Task description:
Make a Drop-Down-TicTacToe  where 9 balls are randomly dropped down from random location in uppermost part of Window. There are two different colored balls (randomly divided). 
User can change their direction using arrow keys left and right before they enter the slots in lower part of the user interface. 
Lower part is divided into 3x3 slots where balls are dropped.  
The purpose is to create as many groups of three same colored balls in a row, column or crosswise. 
If user gets all 9 balls into groups of three in a row the ball speed in  next game is higher. If user manages to get one row the speed in next game  is 1/3 of the previous speed and if user gets 6 balls in a row the speed is half of the previous speed. 

Could add in future versions:
prompt to play again after completion
high score saving feature
possibly also implement some options, like colour themes (radio buttons) for example e.g. orange/blue/dark/light/pink/random...
add a 'special' ball that works with both red and blue?
'space to pause'
'i for instructions'
